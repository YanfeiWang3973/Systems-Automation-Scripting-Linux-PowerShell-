### Overview
Built automation scripts in both Linux (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) to collect system and network data, create reports, and automate setup tasks.  

These labs helped me understand how operating systems work under the hood and how to automate repetitive technical steps.

### Highlights
- Provisioned Ubuntu containers automatically using Bash + LXD  
- Generated system/network reports (hostname, CPU, memory, disk, IP info)  
- Built PowerShell functions to audit hardware, OS, GPU, and network configurations  
- Learned argument parsing, cleanup routines, and formatted CLI outputs  

### Tools
Ubuntu, Bash, PowerShell, LXD, WMI, CIM, Shell Scripting
